Simple Discord rich presence for Plex.

> ⚠️ WARNING: This program works well with the regular Plex application but you may find that there are issues when using Plexamp. This is a problem with the way Plexamp handles webhooks.

## Limitations

Because this program relies on Plex webhooks, unfortunately it is only usable with a Plex Pass subscription.

This program is currently designed for music use, but it can easily be modified to suit the needs of anything that triggers a Plex webhook.

## Set up

For instructions on how to set up Plexcord, please see the [wiki](https://github.com/htbrown/plexcord/wiki).
